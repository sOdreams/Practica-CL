# 🛠️ Toy Compiler – Learning Language Logic

This is a minimal compiler built to explore how programming languages work under the hood.

The project focuses on:

- Parsing syntax using **ANTLR**
- Defining grammars with **regular expressions**
- Understanding how source code becomes executable logic
- Simulating lexical and syntactic analysis
- Building a simple interpreter or intermediate code generator

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here

- ✅ A basic grammar definition
- 🔍 Regex-based token recognition
- 🌲 Parse tree generation and traversal
- ⚙️ Execution logic for a tiny custom language
- 📚 Annotated code to learn from

## 💡 Why I Built This

To demystify the world of compilers and interpreters, and get hands-on with tools like **ANTLR** and regex — turning theory into something real and testable.

## 📦 Technologies

- [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/)
- Python / Java (depending on your setup)
- Regex
- CLI for input and test scripts

## 🧪 Example

```customlang
let x = 3 + 2;
print(x * 4);
